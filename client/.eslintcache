Everyone called me Ricky. I was born\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand raised in Hong Kong until I was 18. Subsequently, I moved\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto California for my college and eventually graduated from\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUCLA with Math major in 2007. Afterward, I got hired by Cathay\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPacific Airways (a Hong Kong based carrier) to work in the\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\toperation management. During my 12 years aviation career, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmoved to serval departments and finally I moved to Seattle as\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta duty manager last year. Even though I worked in aviation\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tindustry but I was keen on computer and coding since I studied\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin High School. As such, I decided to take a coding camp in UW\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto enrich my coding knowledge and make myself prepare to join\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthis industry when the opportunity arise. In the meantime, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tam a dedicated person with a family of three. I have been\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsuccessful at raising a family, and I attribute this success\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto my ability to plan, schedule, and handle many different\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttasks at once. This flexibility will help me in the classroom\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand also my work.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn my free time, I usually spend most of my time on cooking\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand play with my 3-years old son. For some reasons, my mind\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twould be clearer while I am cooking. Hence, I usually spend\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe cooking time to think where necessary. Apart from that, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tloved to play with my son as much as I could. He likes to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tstick with me and his favorite game is hide and seek. He likes\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto hide but ask me to pretend not seeing where he is.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, riding bicycle and playing soccer are some of our\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfavorite sport activities, but for soccer, I prefer watching\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit instead of playing it. My favorite league is English\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPremier League (EPL) while my favorite team is Manchester\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnited. I watched their game since I was 7. Additionally, I\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgot a lot of precious memory with the game where I watched\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twith my father. Other than this, I watched Chinese drama and\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmovie during some of my leisure time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you like my personal site, please like it and feel free to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href='/contact'>contact me</a> for making a personal site\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor you\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t\t\t</section>\r\n\t\t\t</main>\r\n\t\t\t<Footer />\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default about;\r\n","C:\\Users\\ricky\\Desktop\\Bootscamp\\Homework\\week20\\personalreactsite\\client\\src\\components\\footer.js",[],"C:\\Users\\ricky\\Desktop\\Bootscamp\\Homework\\week20\\personalreactsite\\client\\src\\pages\\portfolio.js",["39","40","41","42"],{"ruleId":"43","replacedBy":"44"},{"ruleId":"45","replacedBy":"46"},{"ruleId":"47","severity":1,"message":"48","line":18,"column":10,"nodeType":"49","endLine":23,"endColumn":12},{"ruleId":"47","severity":1,"message":"48","line":189,"column":11,"nodeType":"49","endLine":193,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"47","severity":1,"message":"48","line":221,"column":11,"nodeType":"49","endLine":225,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"47","severity":1,"message":"48","line":253,"column":11,"nodeType":"49","endLine":257,"endColumn":13},{"ruleId":"47","severity":1,"message":"48","line":285,"column":11,"nodeType":"49","endLine":289,"endColumn":13},"no-native-reassign",["50"],"no-negated-in-lhs",["51"],"jsx-a11y/img-redundant-alt","Redundant alt attribute.
